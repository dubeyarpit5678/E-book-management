<h1 id="splitwisecloneapp">Splitwise - clone app</h1>

<p>•    This is a clone app of <a href="https://www.splitwise.com/">Splitwise</a>.</p>

<p>•    It is an app that makes it easy to split bills with friends and family. It allows you to organize all your shared expenses and IOUs in one place, so that everyone can see who they owe. </p>

<p>•    It is a Minimum Viable Product(MVP) version of the original <a href="https://www.splitwise.com/">Splitwise</a> web application. A Minimum Viable Product is the "version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort."</p>

<h2 id="salientfeaturesoftheapp">Salient features of the app</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Users can sign up using "username - password" based registration.</p></li>

<li><p>Users can log in into their accounts, and will be authenticated with the help of "Hasura" Auth API.</p></li>

<li><p>After logging in, users can select from a list of other registered users on the app and add them to their friend-list.</p></li>

<li><p>Users can create groups of 3-4 members by selecting friends from their friend-list and can share/split their expenses equally with other members in the group.</p></li>

<li><p>Provision of uploading an image of the bill with the help of filestore API of Hasura.</p></li>

<li><p>Every logged in user is associated with a randomly generated "auth-token" which is unique for every login session and is used to maintain important user credentials in the Auth API.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

<p>Let us consider an example where a group of friends are out on a road trip and one of them pays the tolls. These tolls can later be equally divided amongst the group of friends and a suitable transaction log will be maintained for the same. A group consisting of these friends needs to be formed and the person needs to upload the bill as an attachment and split the expense equally with the members of the group. Each member will owe an amount equal to <code>total_bill_amount / no. of group members</code> to this user who has uploaded the bill. Not only group expense sharing but peer to peer bill splitting option and transaction management is also equally viable.</p>
